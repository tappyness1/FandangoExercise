# FandangoExercise

This exercise used FiveThirtyEight's dataset which investigated if there was any bias to Fandango's ratings. The dataset can be found in their GitHub repo (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango).

The main purpose for this exercise was to generate scatterplots to identify correlations between its scores and others'. It used subplots. The challenge was that I was lazy to go through each subplot, so I iterated over it to save lines (and probably some processing time).
